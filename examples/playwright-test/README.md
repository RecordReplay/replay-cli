### Playwright Test

This directory contains a single example Playwright test, which can be run from the root of `replay-cli` by running `npx playwright test` (include the `--headed` flag to watch Replay in action).

### Todo List

- Add a playwright/test setup for a simple Next.js App
- Add Replay's Playwright Test Adapter
- Add GH Comments which list the new replay recordings
